# Blockstream — Content Strategy Pills

A brief analysis of Blockstream's brand positioning, tone of voice, and key content challenges, with a practical post rewrite example.

Created as part of my application for a content role at Blockstream.

## What's inside

- Brand promise and core values breakdown
- Tone of voice guidelines mapped by audience (developers, Bitcoiners, enterprise, institutional)
- Three key narratives to counter in content strategy
- A before/after rewrite of a real Blockstream post on X, with analysis and a proposed image
